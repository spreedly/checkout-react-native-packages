2. **Host App Data Practices:** Report your application's own data collection separately
3. **Combined Reporting:** You may need to combine both in your Data Safety section

### Token Storage

If your application stores payment tokens returned by the SDK:

- ✅ Report token storage in your Data Safety section
- ✅ Implement user deletion mechanisms for stored tokens
- ✅ Document token storage practices in your privacy policy
- ✅ Use secure storage mechanisms (Android Keystore, encrypted SharedPreferences)

### Network Permissions

If your application requires INTERNET permission:

- ✅ Declare INTERNET permission in your AndroidManifest.xml
- ✅ Document network usage in Data Safety section if required
- ✅ Note: SDK uses network for payment tokenization only
